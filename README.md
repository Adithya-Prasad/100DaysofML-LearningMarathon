# 100 Days of ML: Join me for a learning marathon!

*I always wanted to take up some challenging work to get organized, and I found a way! I'll be writing articles and building projects over the next 100 days on Machine Learning. I’ll try to cover as many topics as possible, making them simple so everyone can follow along. If you feel like joining me for this marathon, feel free to jump in!*

I'm posting the roadmap for this 100-day journey here so we can stay on track with our goals.
